# DJI (https://www.dji.com) Critique
DJI is the world's largest drone manufacturer. It's website is also one of my favorite websites, so I will evaluate it from three aspects of **Usability**, **Visual Hierarchy** and **Mobile Friendliness**.

## Usability

### Navigation
- This is the most commonly used top navigation. All elements can be displayed quickly on the top.

- The navigation is intuitive and its pixel dimensions are 2543*64.

### Convensions
- There are primary navigation, secondary, tertiary navigation, breadcrumb, utilities and search in the navigation. As a major sales channel, DJI puts the "Store" link on the primary navigation to provide convenience for customers to access the online store.

- However, there is not social links in the navigation. I think that as a professional product website from China, the website designer does not love social media too much, but focuses on the product and sales. 

### Body Text
- This website uses a lot of Microsoft YaHei fonts, which is more suitable for a commercial website.

- The text on both the homepage and the content page is short and clear. The pages of website use a lot of pictures and videos, so that visitors can immediately understand the concept of the products.

- However, I feel the text of primary navigation, secondary navigation and tertiary navigation is a bit small. This will give users a sense of inconsistent proportions.

## Visual Hierarchy

### Overall
The overall impression the homepage gives me is brief and generous and is opened quickly even if there are a lot of pictures on the homepage. As a professional manufacturer of drones and sports shooting equipment, DJI's products have good industrial design, so using pictures to convey product information can quickly catch users' eyes.

###Content Scannable
- I think the content scannable is very good, even though the designer does not use the **Z-Pattern** layout or **zig-zag pattern** layout.
- Due to the symmetrical layout of the page, visitors will use top-to-bottom scanning. At the same time, DJI puts the most important content on the first and second screens. In my opinion, designers do not want users to scan web pages, but rather want users to see what they get when they open the homepage.
- This website uses some short text to describe different products. For example, use "Make Your Moments Fly" to summarize the value of drones and use "Magic At Hand" to summarize the price of handheld video equipment.

### Priciples
- The website uses different sizes of text to tell what's most important, such as the text size of the product name will be larger.
- The pictures of page use good color and contrast. The designer uses dark text on a light background to clarify the meaning of the picture.
- The pictures of page use the same consistent typography, imagery, colour schemes and layout which give people a sense of unity and cohesiveness.
- However, the text of pages does not use left alignment but uses a center alignment mode. I think web designers have abandoned the F pattern ideas, so they adopted this alignment.
- The pictures of homepage are displayed in two per line. If it can be modified to display three per line, it will be more attractive, just like the pictures on online store pages.

##Mobile Friendliness
- When using a mobile phone to open the DJI website, the content of the website is responsive and all the content are parity.
- In addition to responsive,  the sticky navigation is always at the top of the page so that visitors can operate at any time during the visit.
- For ecommerce website, it's essential to have a method for visitors to easily contact. Click-to-call allows the visitors to phone the business in just one tap.

## Summary
In general, DJI website has a simple design, functional use, and reasonable layout. While highlighting the product display, it also brings visitors visual enjoyment. This is a typical generation of high-tech product websites.
